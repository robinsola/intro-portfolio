#### Website Portfolio of Epicodus Projects, 2017

#### By **Robin Sola**

## Description

This website acts as a portfolio for my Epicodus projects. Aside from the homepage, there are two more pages you can access by using the navigation bar. The About me page includes information about who I am, where I've been, and what I like to do. There are also lists of my interests on this page. The Projects page is where you will find links to all of the projects I've completed so far in the Intro to Programming evening class. This website displays what I have learned to do with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap languages.
